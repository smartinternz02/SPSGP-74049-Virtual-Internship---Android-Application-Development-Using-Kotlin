# My Grocery Inventory app 

In this project I Implemented MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of business logic and backend logic, Coroutines and Room Database, RecyclerView to display the list of item, TextView to display item name

# DAO:
Data Access Object (DAO) pattern that allows hide the all the complexity of performing CRUD operations and helps to map the SQL queries
# Repository:
 A repository class abstract access to multiple data sources and manage the data.
# Entity:
 Entity represents a table within the database. Room creates a table for each class that has @Entity an annotation, and the fields in the class correspond to columns in the table.
# ViewModel: 
ViewModel is like a bridge between UI and repository. The role of the VM is to provide data to UI.
# Database: 
Contains the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app’s data.
# RecyclerView:
 It is a container used for displaying large amount of data sets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views.
# Coroutines
Coroutines are a lightweight thread, we use a coroutine to perform an operation on other threads, by this our main thread doesn’t block and our app doesn’t crash.
